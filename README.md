# Git Bundle #

This bundle is an OOP interface for Symfony2. It uses code from [glip][1] and [grit][2] to provide an OOP interface for working
with git repositories. 

# Unit testing #

This bundle is partially-tested right now. Please help improve it by writing more tests
and sending a pull request! 

# Making changes to the API #

If you would like to change the API, change the tests so that the API is how you like it,
then send a pull request explaining your changes. I will then fix the code so that the tests
work.
